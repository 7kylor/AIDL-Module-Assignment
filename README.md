# AIDL-Module-Assignment
Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Module Assignment Task 


Created using Colab

I’ve been experimenting with binary classification in Python the last few months. Today I decided to run my classification tasks on the powerful NVIDIA A100 GPU.

I can see the performance boost is incredible!

The A100 GPU delivers up to 19.5 TFLOPS (FP32) and 312 TFLOPS (Tensor), making it perfect for demanding AI tasks.
